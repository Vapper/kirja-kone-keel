Assess whether this historical Estonian text is readable enough for linguistic analysis,
or if it's too corrupted by OCR (optical character recognition) errors:

"{context}"

Consider:
- Are most words recognizable Estonian words?
- Is the text coherent enough to understand the meaning?
- Are there too many garbled characters or nonsense strings?

Return exactly one word: "readable" or "corrupted".
